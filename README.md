Bob Dylan: Album Ratings Over Time ðŸŽ¶

**tl;dr:** Each dot is a Dylan studio album, rated by *AllMusic*. Arranged by decade, the scatterplots aim to mimim the look and feel of sheet music â€” a fitting way to track Dylanâ€™s ups, downs, and comebacks.  

Dylan's 60s output stands out as the most consistent and acclaimed. After a bumpy ride through the â€™70s, â€™80s, and â€™90s (with fewer albums being released since the 90s), his albums recovered critically and became more stable again in the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.
